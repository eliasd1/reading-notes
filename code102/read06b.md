# What I Learnt From Watching The Videos

- ## *What makes a computer, a computer*
    - needs to take input, store it, process it, and then output it (common to all computers)
    

    Computers have drastically changed since its conception. It started off as a basic calculator, and now they are used for multiple of functions or more complicated tasks

- ## *Four parts of a computer*
    - input - user can tell the computer what to do
    - memory - where information is stored
    - computer's processor - takes information from memory and manipulates it using algorithms (series of commands)
    - output - displays the information

- ## *How Computers Work: Binary And Data*
    Inside a computer there are electrical wires and circuits, which the computer uses to process information.

    Information signals can either be on or off (1 or 0)

    Bit - smallest piece of information a computer can store

    Photos/Videos/Graphics are made up of pixels. Each pixel has a color

    Sound is a series of vibration and can be represented graphically as a waveform. Sound can broken down into a series of numbers

- ## *Circuits And Logic*
    - computers use circuits to process and store information
    - and, or , not circuits (logic gates) can be used to manipulate data
        * more complex tasks can be performed by connecting circuits
    
- ## *CPU, Memory, Input and Output*
    - Keyboard converts the letter to binary
    - Sent to computer for storage and processing
    - CPU calculates how to display the letter pressed
    - CPU requests instructions from memory on how to the letter pressed
    - Result is then stored as pixel into memory 
    - Pixel information is then sent to the display

- ## *Hardware and Software*
    CPU is the master chip that controls all other parts of the computer
    It contains circuits to do math and other circuits to send and receive information. 
    
    CPU receives simple commands that tells it which circuit to use to do a specific job.

    Binary commands are stored in memory, and the cpu fetches and executes them in sequence.

    Operating system other software on a computer, and quickly switches between programs, each program sharing the cpu for a fraction of a second.
