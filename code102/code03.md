# What I Learnt About Today
Dec. 14, 2020
## Git and Github

&nbsp; Today I learnt about git and github. From what I understood, git is a tool used in terminal to store data in a file system. 
It keep tracks of any changes made to files, and I can use it to add changes to the local file system and push those changes to my github repo.

&nbsp; Important commands to remember:

    - git status (checks for any changes made to files in the repo)
    - git add . (prepares all files in a directory to be commited, or saved, to the local file system)
    - git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE" (saves the changes made to the local repo)
    - git push origin main (pushes the changes to the github repo)
    
## HTML
&nbsp; Today we learnt about how to make a list in html. It starts with either a ul or ol tag and within those tags we use li to write items to our list

    Example code:
    <ul>
      <li>Item1</li>
      <li>Item2</li>
    </ul>
    
&nbsp; We also learnt how to make our code more readable by using the following tags: nav, main, section, and article. We use these tasks so it can be easier to navigate through our code

    Example code:
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>Item</li>
      </ul>
    <nav>
    <main>
      <header>
        <h1>Title</h1>
      </header>
      <section>
      </section>
      <article>
        <p>A paragraph</p>
      </article>
    </main>
