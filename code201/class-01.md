## HTML Chapter 1

HTML uses tags to give information to things they surround 

    <h1>Page header<h1>
In the example above, there is an opening tag (start) and closing tag (end).

    Typical structure of an HTML

    <html>
        <head>

        </head>
            <body>

            </body>
    </html>

&lt;head&gt; - contains information about the page

&lt;body&gt; - contains information that will be displayed on the browser
