## “The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications”

- Native web applications have held an adjvantager over web applications in persistent local storage
- Cookies were introduced early in web's history to provide persistent local storag, but they had three problems:
    - slowed down your web applications
    - sending data unencrypted over the internet
    - limited to about 4kb of data

- Microsoft made it posssible to store 64kb per domain using internet explorer
- Adobe in 2006 introduce flash 6, which allowed flash objects to store up to 100kb of data per domain

- HTML5 set out to provide standarized API, implemented natively and consistently in multiple browsers
- HTML 5 storage - a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser
- Data persists even after you navigate away from the website and the data is never transmitted to a remote web server
- You can store data using a named key and then you can retrieve that data with the same key
5 megabytes of data for each origin
