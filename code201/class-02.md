## Chapter 10 - Introducing CSS

CSS allows you to create rules to dictate how elements should appear. These rules contain two parts: selector and declaration. CSS treats each element as if it appears inside it's own box

***CSS selectors***:

- Universal selector - *{}
- Type selector - p{}
- Class selector - .class{}
- ID selector - #id{}
- child selector - li>a{} (selects direct children elements of the parent)
- Descendant selector - p a{} (selects children elements within the parent element)
- Adjacent Sibling selector - h1 +p{} (selects first sibling directly next to the h1 element)
General Sibling selector - h1 ~ p{} (selects all elements that are siblings of the parent element)

CSS rules cascade
- if two rules are identical, the latter of the two will win over
- the more specific rule will take precedence

Inheritance - child elements inherit from the parent element
