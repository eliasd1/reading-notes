# What I Learnt Today

## Constructors 
- object-oriented programming, a way to model things
- use of objects to represent information or data
- constructors can be thought of as a blueprint or scheme
- constructors are named using pascal notation
        
        function ConstructorName(){

        }

## Prototype 
- used to save memory
- a method is applied to a prototype so it's only saved one but every instance of the object has access to it (linking prototype to constructor)


## HTML Chapter 15 Layout
- div elements are used as containing elements to group together sections of a page
- CSS positioning schemes:
    - Normal
    - Relative
    - Absolute
    - Fixed
- Float property allows you to move content to the left or the right of the page
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid layouts
- You can multiple CSS files in one page
