# What I Learnt Today

## Solid Principles

S - Single-responsiblity principle, class should have only one job

O - Open-closed, entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

L - Liskov Substitution

I - Interface segregation, clients should be forced to implement interfaces they will never use

D - Dependency Inversion, entities should depend on abstractions
