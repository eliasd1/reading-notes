# What I Learnt Today

JDK - Java Development Kit
JRE - Java Runtime Environment
JVM - Java Virtual Machine

Compilers - converts high level languages (java, javascript) into machine code

Compiler converts all code and then runs it, whereas the interpreter converts a line of code, runs it, and then 
moves on to the next line

Data types:
Numbers: byte, short, int, float, long, double
Boolean - true or false
Char
String

## Packages and Import

- Java classes are grouped together in packages
- Package = directory
- First statement can have a package declaration
- Import statements allows you to specify classes from other packages that can be used

## A Guide To Java Loops

Loops found in Java:

- for loop - allows you to repeat code by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter
- enhanced for-each loop
- while loop - repeats code while its controlling Boolean-expression is true
- do-while loop - condition evaluation happens after code has been executed once
