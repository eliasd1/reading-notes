- providing backend services on an as-used basis
- no need for underlying infrastructure for writing and deploying code
- company doesn't need to pay a fixed amount for a server, instead the company is charged based on their computation
- autoscaling - dynamically allocates computational resources depending on changes on demand

Advantages of serverless:

- Lower costs
- Simplified scalability
- Simplified backend
