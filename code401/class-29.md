# What I Learnt Today

# Room

- data can be persisted using Room
- cache relavent pieces of data

Three major components of Room:

- Database class - holds the database and serves as the main access point
- Data entities - represents tables in the database
- Data acceses objects - provide methods to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database

Objects stored in the database are represented by entities. Room entities are used to define the database schema.

Since this is a relational database, you can define relationships between entities (one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)
