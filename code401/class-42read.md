## Ethics in the workplace

It is important to maintain integrity when developing code. In some cases, a developer may be required to write code that might result in harm and damage to other people and the developer should be aware of this result. There are some examples of developers who may be young and unknowledgable and may be tricked into writing code that is produces a result that is unethical. Other times, a developer might be afraid of losing his/her job and may comply with demands from employer even if they are unethical. The developer, even under difficult circumstances, should pick the ethical approach and avoid doing harm. In the long term, this will benefit the developer as he/she will develop a reputation of being honest, trustworthy, and ethical.

## Ethics in Technology

In the modern world, hardly anything can be considered private or unknown. Big corporations keep track of user activity, including private activities that the user may want to be kept secret. Some of these companies use data collected to better improve their advertising measures by being able to target specific audience in a more effective and efficient manner. This process can be used to harm individuals by potentially advertising harmful substances to specific audience. For example, a drug company may use this technology to better advertise their products to teenagers. Self-driving cars are incremently improved by keeping track of millions of people's movements. Private information about individual, such as house location, may be exposed to strangers who might have ill intent.
