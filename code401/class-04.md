# What I Learnt Today

## Java OO Tutorial

- Object - software bundle of related state and behavior and are used to model real-world objects
- Class - blueprint or prototype from whcih objects are created

## Java Classes

- Declaring classes

        class MyClass {
        // field, constructor, and 
        // method declarations
        } 

- Member variables in a class are called fields

    - declaring member variables - public int variableName

- Methods are functions within a class
- Constructors can be found in classes and are used to create objects from the class blueprint

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

Decimal - base 10, from 0 to 9

Binary - base 2, only 0 and 1

Hexadecimal - base 16, from 0 to 16, 0-9 and A-F

Example of binary number: 10

Converted to decimal : 2^1 = 2
