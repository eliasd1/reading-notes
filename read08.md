# What I Learnt Today

## While Loops
- allow codes to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition

        Example:
            var x = 10
            while(x !== 10){
                console.log(x);
                x++;
            }

## And/Or/Not Operators
    And - && (all conditions must be true)
    Or - || (atleast one condition must be true)
    Not - ! 

## For Loops
- execute a block of code a number of times

        Example:
            for(let i = 0; i<10; i++){
                console.log(i);
            }

- In the above example, the number of times the code is executed is determined by the second parameter in the for loop (i < 10)
# Other Things I Learnt
- Console.log() - used to display information on the console
    - can be useful when debugging code
- Incrementing/Decrementing variables
    - x++ to increment variables
    - x-- to decrement variables
- Returning a value from a function using the return statement at the end of a function
