# What I Learnt Today

## Updating data

- use a put request to update

- forms can only do get and post requests

- this can be workaround by using a middleware (method-override), which masks the request

## Deleting data

- use a delete request to update

- form post request is masked as a delete request using method-override

## Database Normalization

- organizing a database into tables and columns

- table should be about a specific topic
- Three reasons to normalize a database:
  - minimize duplicate data
  - avoid data modification issues
  - simplify queries
