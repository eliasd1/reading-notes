Path parameters - variable parts of a URL path

Sending Form Data

- forms define how the data will be sent
- request data is sent when the user clicks on the submit button
- Two important attributes:

	- action - defines where the data will be sent
	- method - defines how the data will be sent (get or post method)

- get method requests data from a specific location (defined in action), whereas post method sends a request
to add data to a specific location

- form data can be retrieve in NodeJS by accessing the body object in the request parameter
